# Basic.css - A Stylesheet for Fast Landing Page Launch  
This stylesheet is designed to quickly launch new landing pages using only HTML and CSS. It includes a few special features:  

## Elements Relationship System  
All elements in this system are siblings, friends, housemates, or townmates. We define spacing only between siblings, while the rest of the spacing is calculated using a special formula. This approach saves time when working on adaptivity.  

## Font Scaling System  
In Basic.css, all fonts scale with a coefficient, ensuring consistency across all media queries.  

## Container Sizing System  
Container widths are set to the smallest possible screen width for the current media query. This approach guarantees proper content distribution across all screen sizes.  

## Next Steps for This Project  
There are still many unnecessary repetitions in this stylesheet, but as I work with it, I occasionally find ways to improve it. You are welcome to fork this stylesheet and adapt it to your needs and philosophy.
